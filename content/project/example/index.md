[Devrim Ikizler](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/faculty/di267) and I are principal investigators on this project which will investigate the potential cost structure for plant-based meat alternatives in 2030. 
In this project, we will build a cost of goods sold model and explore how standard components (such as capital costs, labour, ingredient costs etc.) will evolve over the next 8-10 years. We'll also explore how these elements might change as the industry scales (i.e. production capacity increases).
